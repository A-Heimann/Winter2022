# LaTeX, JabRef, Git, and GitHub Tutorial

**Note**: This tutorial is for Arsem Lab.
It is by no means perfect nor complete.
It only shows for beginners who have never used any of the software mentioned in the title, how to get started.
After this tutorial you are able to understand basic Git commands, the basic structure of LaTeX documents and commands, you will understand how are they connected and you will understand how to use them in a simple way.

Although many things are explained, either by video or as comments in the tex files, I am sure you can understand many things just by looking at the examples.

Starting from here you will be well equipped to learn more on your own for your own project.
**Good Luck!**
